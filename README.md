# train-project
This app was a project completed in September 2018. Each time the page is loaded it shows a list of trains stored in firebase and their arrival times. Users can add new trains to the list by entering information into the input boxes and clicking submit. Upon submit, they will see a small bar near the top of the page confiming that they added the train, and the new train will be displayed in the table with the other trains. Created and maintained by Hayley Hartman. For more information see my full portfolio at https://hayleyhartman.github.io/bootstrap-portfolio/
